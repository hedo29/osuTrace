# osuTrace

This is a very elementary project that I first made in the realm of programming. It's not being supported anymore, but, of course, if anyone would like to make future modifications, they absolutely can.

The high level of what this app does:
1. Record your cursor's location on screen
2. Create a dot in a smaller rectangle relative to your cursor's location
3. Change the dot based on what keys/buttons you've pressed
4. Erase any dots beyond the draw length
5. Allow for a basic, simple config

Why:
Osu is a very popular game that gets streamed/recorded often. The game consists of rapidly moving your cursor to a particular location and clicking in time with music.
However, despite being streamed/recorded, there is no functionality to draw a tail behind the cursor, as the different levels (referred  to as "beatmaps") can often involve an artistic flair that would otherwise go unnoticed by viewers.

This application showcases these trails on an alpha layer, which can be used by most streaming applications as an overlay component. Unfortunately, there is no demo video remaining I can find.

This was also my first ClickOnce application. It was abandoned when I had other projects to tackle, but it was requested that I post the source code as it was indeed being used. Please note I have no intention on making new changes to this code, but I may clean up the code and refactor just out of personal preference. I know I've left this code in a "works but messy" state, and that is intentional.
